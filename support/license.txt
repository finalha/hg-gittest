EXHIBIT A
 
Escalation Procedures and Processes for Programs Error Resolution

Classification of Errors

All Errors reported by Customer to NetBrain shall be assigned a Severity Level jointly agreed upon by Customer and NetBrain. The point of contact throughout this initial Error reporting procedure shall be the applicable NetBrain support representative available to Customer under the terms of this Agreement.  Reported Errors shall be classified as follows:

    Severity Level 1-Severity Level 1 implies that the Program(s) is not functioning as a whole. Some examples of Severity Level 1 Errors are as follows:
    1.Both workstation software and server software is down and could not restart;
    2.The appliance hardware is at fault and couldn't start;     

    Severity Level 2-Severity Level 2 implies that the Program(s) is running but that Customer is unable to use major portions of the Program(s), and no Bypass is available. Some examples of Severity Level 2 Errors are as follows:
    1.Production system is generating data corruption with no Bypass; and
    2.Major functional component is unavailable with no Bypass.

    Severity Level 3-Severity Level 3 implies that the Program(s) is operating close to normal, but there is a material  Error for which an operational Bypass exists for such Error. Severity Level 3 Errors will be fixed in the next scheduled Update.

    Severity Level 4-Severity Level 4 includes purely cosmetic Errors and documentation anomalies.

    Out-of-Scope-A reported problem is out-of-scope when it is determined not to be related to the Program(s) and is beyond the bounds of NetBrain's responsibility. Examples of such unrelated problems include, but are not limited to, Customer host or applications Programs, Customer hardware and cabling, power or environmental conditions, and human error.

Severity Level 1

    Error Resolution-Immediate steps shall be taken toward solving the Error. NetBrain shall work to resolve Severity Level 1 Errors continuously until the Error is resolved. If required, NetBrain staff shall be moved off of lower Severity Level Errors to service Severity Level 1 Errors.
    Resource Commitment-When a Severity Level 1 Error is reported, NetBrain shall assign all resources required to correct the Error. Work on the Error shall be continuous until a Fix is found. If system access is required, Customer shall provide a contact available to NetBrain and access to its system and Programs for the duration of the Error correction procedures.
    Completion Goal-The completion goal shall be to resolve one hundred percent (100%) of all Severity Level 1 Errors with a Fix or Bypass within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt of the Error Report.
    Escalation and Status Thresholds-When a Severity Level 1 Error Report is opened, the following escalation and status procedures shall be followed.
    
    Hour 1¨CHour 24
    1.The Error shall be resolved by NetBrain first line support; or
    2.The Error will be referred to the maintenance engineering group. All log files and a description of the work done by NetBrain will be transferred to this group. The report will receive an Error Report number which will be entered into the SMS. The error will be passed to the maintenance engineering group via the SMS as well as by e-mail.
    The Customer will be notified of the status of the Error.
    
    Hour 24
    1.The maintenance engineering point of contact will resolve the Error; or
    2.It will be decided that more resources are required to work on the Error.
    The Customer will be notified of the status of the Error.
    
    Hour 48¨CResolution
    1.NetBrain shall continue to work on the Error continuously, until a resolution is found. All available resources shall be used to assist the person who is responsible for the resolution of the Error; and
    2.The Project Manager and Operations Support Manager shall be notified that a Severity Level 1 Error has reached a critical time frame.

Severity Level 2
    Error Resolution-Severity Level 2 Errors will be analyzed in the order that they are reported.  Severity Level 1 Errors will take priority over Severity Level 2 Errors.
    Resource Commitment-Appropriate technical resources will be assigned to Severity Level 2 issues as long as Severity Level 1 Errors are not open.
    Completion Goal-The completion goal will be to resolve one hundred percent (100%) of all Severity Level 2 Errors with a Fix or Bypass within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt of the Error Report. Escalation and Status Thresholds-When a Severity Level 2 Error Report is opened, the following escalation and status procedures will be followed.
    
    Hour 1-Hour 36
    1.The Error shall be resolved by NetBrain; or
    2.The maintenance point of contact person will be contacted. All log files and a description of the work done by NetBrain will be transferred to this group. An Error Report number will be assigned and entered in the trouble tracking system.
    The Customer will be notified of the status at this stage.
    
    Hour 36-Hour 72
    1.The maintenance engineering point of contact will resolve the Error; or
    2.The maintenance engineer will continue working the Error until it is fixed.
    3.A date will be estimated upon when this Error will be fixed.
    The Customer will be notified of the status at this stage.

Severity Level 3
    Error Resolution-Severity Level 3 errors shall be researched after Severity Level 1 and Severity Level 2 Errors. The majority of the Severity Level 3 Errors shall be scheduled for correction and be resolved as part of the next scheduled Update.
    Resource Commitment-Severity Level 3 Fixes shall be included in the next scheduled Update.
    Completion Goal-The completion goal and objective shall be to correct Errors in the next scheduled Update.
    Escalation and Status Thresholds-The status of Severity Level 3 Errors shall be available on demand. A quarterly report will be distributed that will reference any uncorrected Errors that are over ninety (90) days old.

Severity Level 4
    Error Resolution-Severity Level 4 Errors shall be addressed at NetBrain's discretion after Severity Level 1, Severity Level 2, and Severity Level 3 Errors are corrected. All Severity Level 4 Errors shall be scheduled for correction and be resolved as part of the next scheduled Update.
    Resource Commitment-Severity Level 4 Fixes shall be included in the next scheduled Update.
    Completion Goal-The completion goal and objective will be to correct issues in the next scheduled Update.
    Escalation and Status Thresholds-The status of Severity Level 4 Errors shall be available on demand.
